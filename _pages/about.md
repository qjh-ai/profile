## About Me

I am **Jiehong QIU (邱杰宏)**, a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**.  
My work integrates **Artificial Intelligence**, **Economics**, and **Software Engineering**, with a strong focus on using data-driven and computational approaches to solve complex problems in aviation, materials, logistics, and industrial systems.

I have an interdisciplinary background that combines empirical industrial organization, AI/ML modeling, and scalable software development.  
My current projects include **AI-powered aviation analytics**, **autonomous mobility systems**, **microstructure-based materials modeling**, and **AI agent architectures for engineering intelligence**.

## Research Interest

![Research Interest Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/v1.png)


My research lies at the intersection of **AI as tools**, **Empirical Industrial Organization**, and **Software Engineering as Deliverables**:

- **AI as tools:** Applying modern AI techniques — including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models — to extract insights and enable decision intelligence.  
- **Empirical Industrial Organization:** Leveraging AI and econometrics to analyze real-world markets and systems such as aviation, finance, logistics, and energy, bridging data and economic theory.  
- **Software Engineering as Deliverables:** Translating academic research into tangible deliverables such as AI products, platforms, and learning tools that can be used for teaching, research, and industry collaboration.

The shaded area in the diagram represents my **core research focus** — the integration of AI-driven analytics, economic reasoning, and software deliverables for creating intelligent and interpretable decision systems.
